I can identify at least two security vulnerabilities that I fixed with the refactored code: 
The first is query parameterization, which prevents SQL Injection by blocking malicious scripts from being executed by the database. 
Additionally, I implemented validation for the inserted username field.

As I mentioned in the interview, if this were a real project, I wouldn't put all of this in the Controller. 
Instead, I would have the Controller call a service/use case and encapsulate the database interface using the Repository pattern.
